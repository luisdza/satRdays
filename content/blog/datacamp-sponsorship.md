**TL;DR DataCamp will not be allowed to sponsor or affiliate with satRdays events for a period of one year, or until the C-suite executive who committed the sexual harassment steps down / is let go if that occurs sooner, and then we will re-evaluate their actions towards a safe, accountable culture.**

The satRdays events were set to be an inclusive R event brand that enables communities around the world an easy framework to develop and celebrate their local R community. Diversity and safety at our events are vital principles that everyone commits to and works hard to achieve. We've had a great track record but...

One of our past sponsors for some of the local events has been DataCamp. It came to our attention in December that there had been an dislosed incident of sexual assault performed by a senior member of the DataCamp team. We had a collective call to discuss how satRdays should handle such issues and we've opted for transparency of discussions and results. Our first step was to gather more information.

We had a call with two members of DataCamp's team and pushed them for transparency about the event as they believed they had taken the issue seriously and had handled things appropriately. Due to the lack of public knowledge about the issue we felt it was difficult for us to transparently provide to the community a specific action we were taking so we didn't proceed with a solid action at that point. We opted for a message to our organisers to not have DataCamp as a sponsor whilst this was being resolved.

Since then the DataCamp instructors picked up the torch on pushing for transparency and accountability with DataCamp. Their voices got DataCamp to [publicly acknowledge the incident](https://datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community) and outline some of their handling of it.

We felt then, and still do, that DataCamp took insufficient action and they have sent the message that you can get away with sexual harassment if you're in a position of power. This is not a message we condone and it has no place at our events, even if just by our continued implicit endoresement of DataCamp through accepting sponsorship or material support from them.

Our proposed and agreed upon action is to not allow DataCamp, as a company, to have involvement with our events until the CXO steps down / is fired or until April 2020. When one of these end points is reached, we will then re-evaluate DataCamp's involvement based on their behaviours between now and then. DataCamp employees may still be accepted to speak at our events and will continue to be governed by the same Code of Conduct that all speakers, organisers, sponsors, and attendees are held to during our events and associated activites.

On top of what do regarding DataCamp, this was an important moment of reflection for us as a community events group in pushing us to think about our governance, responsibilities, and behaviours. We are always trying to improve and one of the ways we believe we can do that is for satRdays to be not just a few voices, but a community, so we work out in the open on the [R UG leaders Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rusergroups/shared_invite/enQtMjEyNDA3MzcyMjczLTE3NWEzNjQ3MjZiMWM0OGE2ZWFiZDliNTY4NTJjYWY1NGNjMmNlNDUzNzkzOTZmMDBjYjRiZjFhNjk4MDY0ZGY) and welcome new folks to get involved, engage with on topics like this, and even just see what we're up to.
