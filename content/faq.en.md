Common questions about satRdays

## 1. WHAT ARE SATRDAYS?
SatRdays are R-focused conferences that are held on Saturdays. They happen all over the globe, and are organised by local community leaders to help and grow the local community. There is a big emphasis on making these event accessible - by not requiring time off work, by not costing more than a days wages, by being supportive of new community members or leaders.
